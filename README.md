# probable-system
Python Script to copy the largest file(s) from a folder with optional sub-folders into a destination folder.  

You can choose the largest file based on file type (.txt, .mp3, .doc, etc). 

If this directory/folder structure below resembles what you have, this script helps you in copying and transferring the largest file based on size from each of the sub-directories.

Note 1: The number of sub-directories/files could be any amount that you wish to have.

Note 2: Also, the word directory and folder are interchangable and mean the same thing.
